Data Visualisation

## How my project works

   ### Live Connection
        So for my live connection I imported my data from the web by opening the dataset using my desktop excel application. And copying the path then connect. 
  
   ### High-Level Metrics
        In these page I decided to show the number of devices installed per year whereby the counted number for each year is shown on the card that is that is on the top right. To see which year a certain device was installed you can filter using the spice card next to the graph. I added another slicer which alternates/filters the data using date installed 

   ### Device Monitoring
       In these page I used two graphs, one to show the number of devices in a each category of which the exact number will be showed in the count card at the top right and another to show the number of devices in a each zone of which the exact number will also be shown on the count card at the bottom right. The status card will show you whether that device is active or not as you navigate through the different zones and categories. If use the splices next to each graph to see a device in each category or zone the splices will also automatically show you which zone and category does the device belong to.

   ### Device Registration
       In this scenario I assumed that a device is only registered if it is active. To get to this decision I used the DSTV scenario whereby you can purchase your decoder and the satellite dish but as long as it is not installed and the DSTV offices were not notified about the purchased decoder, your TV will not work. I used a bar chat to show the number of devices per category mainly because it clearly shows the statistics of the data and it allows you to nfilter the date using both the category Id's and the Device names. 

       I used a line chart to show the number of device installed at a specific date because it's much more clearer than the others and it also shows the trend. Then I decided to use a bar chart and a line chart to show the number of Zone Id's per status (active or Inactive) mainly because the graph shows the trend over a period of time while the bar chart show us clearly the difference between the active devices and Inactive devices

       Again as you manipulate the date according to what you want to see the count will be shown on the card in the middle and the status card will change as you pick different cattegories and zones.

   ### Filtering 
        For filtering I used the purple navigator on the right of every page under "filters on every page" since the requirement was to do an all page simulteneouse filtering. Under "filters on every page" you'll be able to filter according to category Id's, Date installed and Zone Id's. Under the above categories that I mentioned above you can choose to filter according to a specific category Id, date installed or zone Id which will be projected in every single page.
